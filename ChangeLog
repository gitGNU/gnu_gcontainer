	* test/gcontainer-demo.c: cleaned up the source.

	* gcontainer/gcontainerable.c: emits the "remove" signal for every
	children in g_containerable_dispose() instead of manually remove the
	GChildables from the list.

	* gcontainer/gcontainerable.[ch]: added g_containerable_propagate()
	and variants to propagate signals to the children of a GContainerable.
	Declared the GChildableIface::propagate_valist() virtual method.

	* === Released 1.0.0 ===

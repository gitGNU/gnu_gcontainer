Version 1.99.1
==============

Corrected a bug in the library installation (gbin.h were not installed).


Version 1.99.0
==============

This is a more serious attempt to provide a generic container to the GObject
world.

After the first release, I realized that libgcontainer was not so generic as
expected. The implementation was quite hugly, using a lot of dirty tricks to
make its job.

Overall, it was by far too early to public a stable package.

Well, errare humanum est, so:

THIS IS THE FIRST DEVELOPMENT RELEASE LEADING UP TO GContainer-2.0.

The API is changed but now the overall design of GContainerable and GChildable
looks more professional.

The most important changes are:

o GContainerable now is a REAL generic container;
o The interfaces design is by far better than the 1.0.0 version;
o Added a new container (GBin) to own one child;
o GContainerable and GChildable interfaces now manage mutual recursion
  inclusions their dispose default implementations, using a complex but quite
  elegant solution.


Version 1.0.0
=============

* First public release.
